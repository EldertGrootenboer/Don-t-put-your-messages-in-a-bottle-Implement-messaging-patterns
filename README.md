# Don't put your messages in a bottle; Implement messaging patterns
When building enterprise solutions, messages are the heart of our communication. They convey commands and data between various systems and ensure that we can work in a decoupled, scalable, and distributed manner. Our messages represent value, so we can't just slip them in a bottle, toss them into the ocean, and hope they arrive at their destination. Instead, we need a messaging backbone that can provide resilience and stability. Therefore, we implement proven messaging patterns, to ensure they are handled with the care they deserve.

In this session we will have a look at these messaging patterns, and how they can help in modern software architecture. As a result we come to understand how secure and reliable communication help us solve complex messaging challenges. 

Come and learn about handling transactions involving different systems, implementing data consistency across them, and controlling intermittent and critical failures. The patterns explained in this session are vendor agnostic, we will use Azure Service Bus to explain some of the specifics, however they can be applied to any message broker.
